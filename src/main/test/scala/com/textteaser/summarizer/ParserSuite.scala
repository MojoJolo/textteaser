    longTextBuilder ++= "that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty "
    longTextBuilder ++= "through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. "
    longTextBuilder ++= "These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, "
    longTextBuilder ++= "when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do "
    longTextBuilder ++= "what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. "

    textBuilder ++= "of their constituent particles, notably their electrons. The way these absorb and emit "
    textBuilder ++= "light would shift towards the blue part of the spectrum if atoms were to grow in mass, "
    textBuilder ++= "and to the red if they lost it.  Because the frequency or ÒpitchÓ of light increases with mass, "
    textBuilder ++= "Prof Wetterich argues that masses could have been lower long ago. "
    textBuilder ++= "If they had been constantly increasing, the colours of old galaxies would look red-shifted Ð"
    textBuilder ++= "and the degree of red shift would depend on how far away they were from Earth. "

    textBuilder ++= "Although his research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed publication, Nature reports "
    textBuilder ++= "that the idea that the universe is not expanding at all Ð or even contracting Ð is being taken "
    textBuilder ++= "seriously by some experts, such as Dr HongSheng Zhao, a cosmologist at the University of "

    textBuilder ++= "I think it is fascinating to explore this alternative representation of the cosmic expansion, where the evolution"
    textBuilder ++= "of the universe is like a piano keyboard played out from low to high pitch.Ó  Prof Wetterich takes the detached,"

    textBuilder ++= "either the distances between galaxies grow, as in the traditional balloon picture, or the size of atoms "
    textBuilder ++= "shrinks, increasing their mass. Or itÕs a complex blend of the two. One benefit of this idea"
    textBuilder ++= "is that he is able to rid physics of the singularity at the start of time, a nasty infinity where "
    textBuilder ++= "the laws of physics break down. Instead, the Big Bang is smeared over the distant past : "
    textBuilder ++= "the first note of the ''cosmic pianoÕÕ was long and low-pitched.  Harry Cliff, a physicist working at CERN"
    textBuilder ++= "who is the Science MuseumÕs fellow of modern science, thinks it striking that a universe where particles are "
    textBuilder ++= "getting heavier could look identical to one where space/time is expanding. ÒFinding two different "
    textBuilder ++= "ways of thinking about the same problem often leads to new insights,Ó he says. ÒString theory, "
    textBuilder ++= " for instance, is full of 'dualitiesÕ like this, which allow theorists to pick whichever view "
    textBuilder ++= "makes their calculations simpler.Ó  If this idea turns out to be right Ð and that is a very big "
